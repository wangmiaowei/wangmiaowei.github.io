He is currently a PhD student in the [School of Informatics](https://informatics.ed.ac.uk/) at [the University of Edinburgh](https://www.ed.ac.uk/), where his research focuses on controllable motion representation in 4D vision and computer graphics. He has strong academic and industrial experience in computer vision, computer graphics and machine learning. His PhD journey is fortunately advised by [Prof. Amir Vaxman](https://avaxman.github.io/) and [Prof. Oisin Mac Aodha](https://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/omacaod/).

Previously, he completed his graduate studies in the [Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science](https://eecs.engin.umich.edu/) at the University of Michigan, under the supervision of [Prof. Jason Corso](https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~jjcorso/).  He also collaborated closely with [Prof. Daniel Morris](https://www.egr.msu.edu/~dmorris/) at [Michigan State University](https://msu.edu/) on research in 3D vision.

## 📝 Representative Publications *(First Authorship)*

1. **CanFields: Consolidating Diffeomorphic Flows for Non-Rigid 4D Interpolation from Arbitrary-Length Sequences**

   *Accepted to ICCV 2025*
   
   We reconstruct a continuous spatiotemporal manifold from sparse point clouds, addressing the challenge of non-rigid 4D shape interpolation.

2. **DecoupledGaussian: Object-Scene Decoupling for Physics-Based Interaction**
   
   *CVPR 2025*
   
   A framework for simulating dynamic interactions involving contact and separation, by decoupling object and scene in a physically-aware manner.

3. **Self‑Annotated 3D Geometric Learning for Smeared Points Removal**

   *WACV 2024*
   
   Proposes a self‑supervised method to remove smeared or noisy points in LiDAR/depth‑sensor data by learning consistent 3D geometric structures without manual annotations.
